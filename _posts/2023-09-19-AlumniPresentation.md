# Takeaways

# Reflection

The alumni shared some really useful advice about computer science. They talked about applying for programs and mentioned that getting into UCSD's computer science program can be like winning a lottery. They suggested trying for mechanical engineering as it might be a bit easier to get in. It's also important to apply to lots of places because it's hard to predict what will happen.

They stressed the importance of joining clubs or activities related to coding. CodeNinjas and anything involving teaching were highly recommended. Even if computer science isn't for everyone, it's still really important to learn about because it's connected to so many things in the world.

Making your own projects, like building a website or creating something unique based on existing websites like Amazon or YouTube, is a great idea. They also mentioned using tools like AWS and Vercel to put your projects online. Having a personal website with your resume is a good idea, and it doesn't cost much to have your own domain.

When it comes to coding, using a tool called Tailwind CSS can make it easier and faster. It's also important to keep up with new software and learn how to use tools like CHATGPT. Finding machine learning courses online and adding those to your resume is a good move.

For internships and jobs, platforms like LinkedIn and Indeed are really helpful. It's even better if someone you know can recommend you. Startups in San Diego might not always have formal internship programs, but if you can show them you're a good fit, they might hire you.

They ended by emphasizing how important it is to do internships while in college, because it can be really tough to find a job without that experience. Overall, their advice highlighted the value of being proactive, learning new things, and making connections in the world of computer science.
